<h3>HTML & CSS Design Challenge</h3>
<h5>Hello There, My Lovely! <br>
Cheers, Sweet Susan</h5>

Hi Folks! Welcome to a website for people interested in happiness. 

Not really - this, instead, is a shallow overview of variables juxtaposed against self-identified happiness scores. Both the happiness scores and variables explored were harvested throgh the meticulous research of the scientists scross the globe via the Sustainable Development Solutions Network. 

Ultimately, this project was more about developing and testing approaches to HTML and CSS styling elements. We were asked to include specific Bootstrap components, a lovely and powerful web design framework. 

The additional funcationlity of hovering, left popping dropdowns, etc were my own added flare. I wanted to take the basic requirewments and create something unique. The analyses aren't strong - but the point of this exercise was to build a website. Which I think I did pretty damn well.

I hope you judge kindly - I am learning. =) Thanks, friend.
